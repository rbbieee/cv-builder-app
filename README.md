# CV Builder App

A simple web application to create and download a CV in PDF format using React and Vite

---

## Why I Built This

I built this project to practice frontend development using React. I wanted to create something practical that people can actually use, not just a basic tutorial project

The idea is simple: users can fill in their personal information, see a live preview of their CV, and download it as a PDF file. Through this project, I learned more about component structure, state management, and working with external libraries like jsPDF

This is mainly a learning project, but I tried to make it clean and usable
